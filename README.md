# CNN_layer_vis

Convolutional neural networks are amazing and absolutely should be a part of any data scientist's toolkit. I realized a little while
ago that, even though I understood the math behind CNNs, I lacked a tool for visualizing what was going on within the model itself. With this mind,
I decided to write a very simple CNN that could be run without a GPU and with a bit of code to extract the activations
for an image, as well as the weights for convolution filters. 

To run the code, call:

python3 CNN_layers.py

Simple!
